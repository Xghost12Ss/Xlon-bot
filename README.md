# Discord Bot Base

A Discord Bot Base, built on top of <a href="https://discord.js.org">discord.js</a>.

# Installation

This bot runs on [node.js](https://nodejs.org). You will need at least node 12. In order for music playback to work, you will need python and ffmpeg to be present on your system.

Run `npm install` in the bot directory and make sure it passes.

# Setting up

Before the first run you must enter your bot token in the file `config.json`.

[Please see this excellent guide for how to create your discord bot's account and get your bot token.](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)

Open cmd and type `npm install discord.js` after installing discord.js type `node .` now your bot is online.

## I want to add a command!

Take a look at the ping command as an example, you can find it in the commands folder.
